<H3>RESEARCH INTERESTS</H3>
My primary research interests center around **optimal and equitable resource planning in service systems**
leveraging large-scale datasets
via the development and application of\
(a) **Optimization under uncertainty**\
(b) **Multi-objective optimization**\
(c) **Graph-based models and algorithms**\
(d) **Data analytics and machine learning**

The examples of the applications includes:\
(1) In **healthcare**: operating rooms and intensive care units management, data-driven patient and clinician scheduling;\
(2) In **product development and manufacturing**: process planning and scheduling, product lifecycle management (PLM) systems, product-service manufacturing systems.

<H3>PROJECTS</H3>


**Optimal Scheduling of Physicians and Certified Registered Nurses**, at
UTSA and UTHealthSA;
- Developed data-driven scheduling and analytics framework with novel mixed-
integer multi-objective programming formulation and solution methods to support clinical operations and strategic decisions.
- Embedded in the Department of Anesthesiology, working hand-in-hand with
the front-line clinicians and administrators from UTHealthSA.
- The developed framework has been implemented and deployed for anesthesiology scheduling and operational analysis with more than 200 providers. This
improved physician schedule satisfaction from 3.13/5 to 3.47/5, and relieved at
least 82% of scheduling burdens on departmental leaders.


**Development and Application of Data Analytics for Smart PLM systems**, at SU and collaborated with two local companies, i.e., Filtertech, Inc. and UsPLM, Inc.;
- Developed a novel algorithm framework for the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem, exact and improved estimation algorithms were created using the framework.
- Developed a novel graph-based formulation approach for process planning and scheduling problems with its solution methods using the concept of MWIS.
- Built product design libraries (50+ products and 500+ components) for small
kitchen appliances and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)

- Developed visual analytics, product configuration, resource allocation, and process 
planning and scheduling modules for the Smart PLM system, and deployed
these tools for the engineering design department at Filtertech, Inc.

- Developed and deployed digital twin and flight mission configuration services
for the drone fleet management solution at UsPLM, Inc., Key contributor to
win Genius NY 2018 investment competition, **$250,000** (external, NY State and <a href="https://www.thetechgarden.com/">The Tech Garden</a>)

- Development of Educational and Training Materials for Unmanned Aerial Systems, 
wrote the proposal for the Gryphon Sensors grant, **$20,000** (external).
