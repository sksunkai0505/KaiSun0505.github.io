\
I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** in Department of Management Science and Statistics housed in **Alvarez College of Business** at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).\
I am also an **Adjunct Assistant Professor** (researcher/consultant in healthcare operations and analytics) in Department of Anesthesiology at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHealthSA).

[//]: # (<span style="color:red">**I am on the job market for tenure-track faculty positions starting Fall 2024.**</span>)

My primary research interests center around **optimal and equitable resource planning in service systems**
via the development and application of\
(a) **Optimization under uncertainty**\
(b) **Multi-objective optimization**\
(c) **Graph-based models and algorithms**\
(d) **Data analytics and machine learning**

The examples of the applications includes:\
(1) In **healthcare**: operating rooms and intensive care units management, data-driven patient and provider scheduling;\
(2) In **product development and manufacturing**: process planning and scheduling, product lifecycle management (PLM) systems, product-service manufacturing systems.

I received Ph.D. and M.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering with a focus on Operations Research from Syracuse University in 2020 and 2015, respectively.
I received a B.E. in Automotive Engineering from Hefei University of Technology in 2013.
