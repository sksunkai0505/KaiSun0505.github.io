\
I am an **Assistant Professor** in **Department of Information Systems** housed in **College of Engineering and Information Technology (COEIT)** at **University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)**.\
I am also an Adjunct Assistant Professor (researcher/consultant in healthcare operations and analytics) in Department of Anesthesiology at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHealthSA).

[//]: # (<span style="color:red">**I am on the job market for tenure-track faculty positions starting Fall 2024.**</span>)

My primary research interests center around **optimal and equitable resource planning in service systems**
via:\
(a) **Optimization under uncertainty**\
(b) **Multi-objective optimization**\
(c) **Graph-based models and algorithms**\
(d) **Data analytics and machine learning**

The examples of the applications includes:\
(1) In **healthcare**: clinician wellbeing, operating rooms and intensive care units management, data-driven patient and provider scheduling;\
(2) In **product development and manufacturing**: process planning and scheduling, product lifecycle management (PLM) systems, product-service manufacturing systems.

Before joining UMBC, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Department of Management Science and Statistics housed in Alvarez College of Business at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).
I received Ph.D. and M.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering with a focus on **Operations Research** from Syracuse University in 2020 and 2015, respectively.
I received a B.E. in Automotive Engineering from Hefei University of Technology in 2013.

Our group is actively looking for <span style="color:red">**self-motivated undergraduate, master, Ph.D. and visiting students.**</span> If you are interested, please email your CV to <ins>ksun1@umbc.edu</ins>.
