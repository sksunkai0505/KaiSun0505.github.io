I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** in the Department of Management Science and Statistics housed in the Alvarez College of Business at The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). 
I am also an **Adjunct Assistant Professor** in the Department of Anesthesiology at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHealthSA).

**I am on the job market for tenure-track faculty positions starting Fall 2024.** 

My primary research interests center around decision support for real-world problems in healthcare and service systems 
via the development and application of\
(a) Data-driven optimization,\
(b) Graph-based models and algorithms,\
(c) Multi-objective optimization,\
(d) Data analytics and machine learning tools.

The examples of the applications includes:\
(1) In **healthcare**: operating rooms and intensive care units management, data-driven patient and clinician scheduling;\
(2) In **product development and manufacturing**: process planning and scheduling, product lifecycle management (PLM) systems, smart manufacturing.

I received Ph.D. and M.S. in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Syracuse University in 2020 and 2015, respectively.
I received a B.E. in Automotive Engineering from Hefei University of Technology in 2013.
