Teaching and tutoring experience centered on courses related to PLM systems, which
manage a product and associated data through all stages of the product lifecycle,
including:
- Product design, development, and manufacturing that are the activities managed
by the PLM systems;
- Data analytics that are the functionalities built into the PLM systems;
- Project management and decision making that is supported by the PLM systems;
- The associated software tools that are interacting with the PLM systems.

The courses included:
