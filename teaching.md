Teaching and tutoring experience centered on courses related to PLM systems, which
manage a product and associated data through all stages of the product lifecycle,
including:
- Product design, development, and manufacturing that are the activities managed
by the PLM systems;
- Data analytics that are the functionalities built into the PLM systems;
- Project management and decision making that is supported by the PLM systems;
- The associated software tools that are interacting with the PLM systems.

The courses included:
- MAE 284: Introduction to CAD (UGRAD), 100+ students 2016-2019\
Topics: • 2D and 3D engineering drawing with SolidWorks for engineering designers
(consisting of half course credit hours)
